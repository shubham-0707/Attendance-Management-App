# Attendance-Management-App
- This App is made to track the attendance of the students in a convenient manner.
- In this app there is a feature to add class , modify class and also to delete class.
- Inside the class screen the user can add students , modify the student's details and also can delete students.
- And then after creating the class the user can easily take the attendance of the students.
- The list item will turn red for absent and turn green for present.
- The list item should be clicked twice to mark a student as absent.
- After taking the attendance of the class the user can safely save the attendance of the class by simply clicking the save button on the action bar.
- And also the user can view the attendance of the class of any day or date.
- Then at any point of time during the month the user can generate the attendance sheet of the students.
- By generating the attendance sheet it becomes easy to check the attendance of every student at a single place of the whole month.
- Now I will add a feature soon to the app to print the attendance sheet for sending or saving to drive in pdf format.
